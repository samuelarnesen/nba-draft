Brandom Ingram,2016,SI,6/20/16,1,,,"It sounds like the Sixers are almost-definitely going to draft Ben Simmons first. You can justify both players there, but I_m sticking with Ingram as the top overall prospect. He is not as physically prepared for the NBA, but Ingram_s combination of scoring instincts and shooting ability offer him a clear pathway to NBA success and lessen the risk involved in his development. In a draft where there are few _wow_ prospects, Ingram offers the best combination of low risk and high reward.",,,,,
Ben Simmons,2016,SI,6/20/16,2,,,"Simmons is one of the more unique talents to come along in decades, and all signs point to him being selected No. 1. He is not a scorer by trade, nor a highly instinctive or diversified one, but his innate passing ability at his size makes him special. Drafting him means committing to putting shooters around him and enabling him to do what he does best as a ballhandler. Building that roster also means investing time and assets, and enabling is a key word here for a kid whose approach to the game and handling of adversity has come into question. But if it all comes together right, he could be a spectacular player indeed.",,,,,
Dragan Bender,2016,SI,6/20/16,3,,,"I loved the Toni Kukoc comparison that Luke Winn posed in SI_s recent feature on Bender. Bender_s not unlike Simmons in that sense as an oversized passer, although he doesn_t facilitate offense on the ball in the same fashion. With his playmaking, shooting potential and unselfishness at 7' 0"", Bender has the talent to become a weird but fashionable offensive cog for a good team. As he grows into his body, his place on the floor defensively should become clearer. He_s the youngest player in the draft, too.",,,,,
Jamal Murray,2016,SI,6/20/16,4,,,"In a different draft class, Murray might go in the 10_15 range. He_s not the most athletic guard in the class, but he gets buckets and scouts love his confidence. His college production, shooting ability and the fact he won_t turn 20 until February give him plenty of value for teams seeking a long-term upside play. His craftiness and ability as a secondary playmaker should let him play a bit of both guard spots. He may slip a little on draft night given teams_ guard depth from picks 3_5, but not too much further.",,,,,
Kris Dunn,2016,SI,6/20/16,5,,,"Rumors are heavily linking Dunn to the Timberwolves, and that makes a lot of sense, despite the presence of Ricky Rubio. He_s a Tom Thibodeau type. Dunn should be a plus defender who can run the offense and get to the rim. He_s a great athlete and is one of the most NBA-ready players in the draft. What exactly is Dunn_s ceiling will probably be tied to the development of his three-point shot. He_s the best point guard available, regardless.",,,,,
Henry Ellenson,2016,SI,6/20/16,6,,,"Ellenson has a very wide range of lottery outcomes, probably more than most in what_s already shaping up as an unpredictable first round. There_s no denying his talent offensively, distinguished by his mix of low-post scoring, jump shooting and ballhandling skills. The knock here is he_s not an explosive athlete nor a strong lateral defender, but if you_re playing him at center it could mitigate some of those concerns. True stretch five-men are hard to find.",,,,,
Buddy Hield,2016,SI,6/20/16,7,,,"Hield apparently made 85 out of 100 threes in a recent Celtics workout and also told reporters he thinks he_s going to the Lakers. Neither of those two things matter much_we already knew he could shoot, and a leap into the top two would be stunning. Regardless, the elite three-point stroke and an otherwise regular skill-set gives the J.J. Redick comps credence. Though he_s 22 already, the development he showed over four college seasons actually plays in his favor with some scouts. Hield should be able to help you right away._ WhyÿHieldÿis the NBA draft_s best shooter",,,,,
Marquese Chriss,2016,SI,6/20/16,8,,,"Some mocks have Chriss going in the top five based on his potential alone. That_s justifiable, but around here feels like more of his range. He_s got almost every tool you can ask for, but also hadn_t played much high-level basketball before coming on late at Washington. He almost definitely doesn_t know how good he can be. We_ve seen guys with similar profiles and better pedigrees float in and out of the league. As a stretchy, bouncy, scoring four-man, Chriss will be a sexy pick, but he_ll have a greater learning curve than most.",,,,,
Jakob Poeltl,2016,SI,6/20/16,9,,,"Poeltl_s a throwback big, andÿit_s almost working against him in the court of public opinion. Also working against him is the fact that not many teams in the top 10 reallyÿneedÿa center. But look, he_s massive and has a well-developed post game, and there will be a place for those types of guys even as the league begins to skew small. He got noticeably better from freshman to sophomore year of college. Big men always take time. He_sÿa fairly safe pick in my book.",,,,,
Jaylen Brown,2016,SI,6/20/16,10,,,"Something here just doesn_t quiteÿmove the needle like it should. Brown has every athletic tool in the book, but had a well-publicized rough go at Cal and probably lacks the basketball acumenÿto contribute early on. Big potential means he could conceivably go in the top five, but the opportunity cost could be high. He_s a smart kid, but can also overthink the game. One scout put it like this: _At least Gerald Green came in with a wet jump shot._",,,,,
Timothe Luwawu,2016,SI,6/20/16,11,,,"Two-way wings are always a valuableÿcommodity, and Luwawu_s one of the best ones in a thin class. He_s a highlight-caliber athlete with a wingspan over 7_0_ feet and shouldn_t slip too far from here. Scouts I spoke with felt he was closer to NBA-ready than most. Luwawu_s got a more diverse offensiveÿgame than just his dunk reel, and has made big strides in the past year. There_s a lot to like with him.",,,,,
Deyonta Davis,2016,SI,6/20/16,12,,,"Everything is about projectionÿwith Davis. His length, quick feet and great shot-blocking instincts portend defensive success. With improving touch and a semblance of a jump shot, you can mold him on offense, too. He played a good bit for Tom Izzo, which matters, but there_s not much ofÿa sample size or history of production to bank on. He_s a long way away from ready, but then again, there are a lot of guys in that same boat this year.",,,,,
Domantas Sabonis,2016,SI,6/20/16,13,,,"Sabonis plays exactly how you_d think the son of a Hall of Fame European big man would. Great fundamentals, soft hands, high motor and IQ. His Gonzaga production backs things up well. The issue is his lack of explosion and length, which raises questions about exactly what translates at the next level. Mid-first round and onward, Sabonis offers some safe value. There_s speculation he has a promise from a team in the late lottery._ SI Longform: Sabonis_s crazy recruiting saga",,,,,
Furkan Korkmaz,2016,SI,6/20/16,14,,,"The combination of athleticism, shooting and youth make Korkmaz a very interesting stash candidate. He_s starred for Turkey at youth levels and shown flashes while playing with Efes_s senior team, but it_s worth noting how relatively small his sample size is against elite competition. He_s a long-term investment, not an immediate-impact selection.",,,,,
Skal Labissiere,2016,SI,6/20/16,15,,,"I have a hunch Labissiere slides toward the late teens on draft night. There_s just too much riding on projection with an older prospect who_s behind developmentally and with little history of consistent production. He_s big and might be able to shoot it and block shots, but he_s already 20 and has filling out left to do. Labissiere missed his junior season of high school with a back injury that has left lingering questions for teams. He could be a worthwhile gamble for teams with the time and resources to develop him. But, as one scout put it: _It_s really hard to play in the NBA not knowing how to play basketball.__ After the Quake:ÿLabissiere_sÿjourney to UK",,,,,
Denzel Valentine,2016,SI,6/20/16,16,,,"Valentine_s production (19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.8 assists) was outstanding last season, and his feel and playmaking help balance the lack of eye-popping athletic measurables. He won_t play the same ball-dominant role as a pro, but you_re buying him as a secondary ballhandler who can space the floor and hoping he catches up defensively. Teams have concerns about the condition of his right knee, which could cause him to slip a bit on draft night.",,,,,
Demetrius Jackson,2016,SI,6/20/16,17,,,"Jackson is tough and extremely athletic and has a good chance to be the second point guard drafted. He_s coming off a strong year at Notre Dame, but his shooting percentages dipped as he shouldered more of the scoring load. Skill-wise, he_s somewhat a master of none. His actual production will have to catch up to his tools. Scouts wonder if he_s cut out to be more than a reserve long-term, but he has decent value in this range.",,,,,
Wade Baldwin,2016,SI,6/20/16,18,,,"Baldwin_s combine measurements_6' 4"" with aÿ6' 11"" wingspan_certainly validated his case as a defensive stopper with a chance to be more. His offense hasn_t sold some scouts, and he_s not a natural point guard in the purest sense, but he can hit a shot and could perhaps be better suited for a lower-usageÿrole. Multiple scouts have cited his tendency to overthinkÿand get in his own way. Still, his defensive potential gives him a relatively high floor.",,,,,
Ante Zizic,2016,SI,6/20/16,19,,,"Near the top of the list among stash candidates is Zizic, a garbage-man type who knows his role, works hard on the glass and is physically mature enough to accomodate his preferred style. Impressive production as a teenager in the Adriatic League (13 points, eight rebounds per game) definitely stands out. Zizic_s skills have a ways to go, but it_s easy to see him as a nice complementary piece on the inside.ÿ",,,,,
Dejounte Murray,2016,SI,6/20/16,20,,,"One optimistic scout calls Murray, simply, _a baller._ _He does some things you can_t teach,_ another says. This is the crux of his intrigue, and while he_s going to need some time, he_s a definite upside play as a scoring combo guard. His shot is a work in progress. On talent and projection you can justify him in the late lottery, but his range appears pretty wide._ Mock Draft roundtable: Predicting first round",,,,,
Taurean Prince,2016,SI,6/20/16,21,,,"Prince did a little bit of everything for Baylor, with a game one scout described as _unconventional._ He_s long and strong and should be able to cut it athletically, and while he struggled some as a senior when tasked with making plays on the ball, odds are he won_t be asked to do as much of that in the NBA. Although he lacks an elite skill to hang his hat on, he should be able to step into a rotation pretty quickly.",,,,,
Tyler Ulis,2016,SI,6/20/16,22,,,"Ulis has solidified himself as a mid- to late-first rounder, and he_s probably the most instinctive passer among available guards. He won_t make many mistakes, and he_ll make everyone around him better. _Three inches taller,_ one scout says, _and he would be the best point guard in this draft._ Medical concerns about his hip and his extremely thin frame gives some reason for pause.",,,,,
Cheick Diallo,2016,SI,6/20/16,23,,,"Diallo is bouncy, aggressive and has a reputation for playing extremely hard. With added seasoning, he should become a useful energy big.His considerable length helps compensate for his lack of height. He_s not a scorer beyond the dunks and hustle bucket, which limits his upside. Diallo was buried in the Kansas rotation, but will be granted more patience from here.ÿ",,,,,
Deandre Bembry,2016,SI,6/20/16,24,,,"Bembry_s one of those players who just gets it. He_s got a mature game and the college production to back it up. He_s low-risk in that you can see him meshing into any offense with his playmaking and versatility. The major question is his three-point shot, but it_s not broken and if you play him alongside shooters it should alleviate some of those spacing concerns. Bembry could make an impact early in his career and help a playoff team next season._ Bembryÿcarries heavy heart into the draft",,,,,
Ivica Zubac,2016,SI,6/20/16,25,,,"Zubac turned heads with insane production at the 2015 FIBA U19 Worlds (33.7 PER, 17.6 points, 7.9 rebounds). He_s a strong finisher with a great frame and nice post-up game. Zubac has potential to cut it defensively and should be a fit at the next level as a screen-setter and rim-runner. He apparently prefers to come over to the NBA next season, but can justify a place on someone_s bench given his tools and possibilities. If you can stash him, even better.",,,,,
Thon Maker,2016,SI,6/20/16,26,,,"Opinions remain mixed on Maker, but it seems scouts are beginning to come around a bit. He_s a legit 7-footer, long and mobile, but, of course, rail-thin. People like his intangibles, yet there are still a ton of ifs when figuring out which of his strengths actually translate to the league. He might be an athletic energy big who can step out and make a shot, he also may never be able to bang inside. Maker has been working out against Brandon Ingram leading up to the draft and apparently held his own. There_s a wide range of outcomes here._ How does Maker project as an NBA player?",,,,,
Juan Hermangomez,2016,SI,6/20/16,27,,,"Hernangomez enjoyed a strong season in Spain and won_t turn 21 until September. A skilled stretch-four who could eventually play some three, he_s comfortable getting his offense spotting up and finishing inside. One scout cited Hernangomez_s high energy level and deceptive leaping ability. It helps he_s already playing legit minutes and producing in a very tough league. Think late first round.",,,,,
A.J. Hammons,2016,SI,6/20/16,28,,,"There_s no reason Hammons shouldn_t be a useful rim protector from day one. He_ll turn 24 soon, which will keep him out of the upper reaches of the draft, but he_s an NBA-level talent with an improving offensive skill level and pro-ready body. The question with him has always been his motor, and teams are fully aware of some off-court discipline issues at Purdue. There are a lot of ifs, but Hammons could surprise if the lightbulb starts to go off.",,,,,
Malik Beasley,2016,SI,6/20/16,29,,,"An athletic slasher with a nose for the basket, Beasley demonstrated the ability to score at all three levels in his one season at FSU, and improved as the year went on. He can shoot it, has a great frame and brings notably strong intangibles in terms of makeup and competitiveness. He has a metal rod in his leg after a stress fracture injury that will concern teams.",,,,,
Stephen Zimmerman,2016,SI,6/20/16,30,,,"Zimmerman has great size and mobility, and a pretty nice shooting touch. He_s not a guy who really loves to bang inside and has a tendency to float away from the basket too much. He_ll need to bulk up to play center and to defend his position. He_s a dart throw, but taking a chance on a stretch big with some upside isn_t the worst thing in this range.",,,,,
Diamond Stone,2016,SI,6/20/16,31,,,"Stone can really score inside, and he_s still quite young. He has a good amount of upside because of it. But he was inconsistent in his one college season, didn_t rebound extremely well and needs work on his body and conditioning. Scouts are concerned how he_ll handle the adjustment to the NBA_s rigorous demands. The questions about makeup and his ability to stay on the floor defensively may hurt his stock.",,,,,
Pat McCaw,2016,SI,6/20/16,32,,,"As three-and-D types go in this draft, McCaw checks out well: his shooting stroke and defensive length (6' 10"" wingspan) are tangible strengths, and he_s developing as a playmaker. He could provide first-round type value if it all pans out, but he_s extremely skinny and will take some time to mature.",,,,,
Caris LeVert,2016,SI,6/20/16,33,,,"LeVert would probably be a lottery pick if not for his extensive history of leg and foot injuries. That said, he was extremely productive in college and has one of the more complete skill-sets among guards in this class. He could be extremely valuable and a steal if he falls into this range, but he could also just get injured again.",,,,,
Malachi Richardson,2016,SI,6/20/16,34,,,"One of the biggest climbers in recent weeks, Richardson parlayed his moment in the NCAA tournament into serious NBA looks and could go in the first round given his frame and shooting potenial on the wing. He_s a bit one-dimensional at this stage, looking mostly for his offense, and isn_t the most explosive athlete. There are still more questions than answers.",,,,,
Damian Jones,2016,SI,6/20/16,35,,,"People are somewhat split on Jones, whose physical tools and defensive ability profile well. He never quite put everything together at Vandy, but in a simplified NBA role, he could thrive. His athleticism has bought him a chance to rectify all of that. He has a case in the late first round.",,,,,
Malcolm Brogdon,2016,SI,6/20/16,36,,,"Given he_s one of the most experienced players in the draft, it_s easy to see Brogdon sneaking into a rotation right away, a la Norman Powell or Josh Richardson. He_s not a crazy upside play, but a diversified two-way skill-set certainly holds appeal. His nearly 7' 0"" wingspan pops out, although he_s not all that explosive or quick. You kind of know what you_re getting here.",,,,,
Ben Bentil,2016,SI,6/20/16,37,,,"Bentil profiles as a quality rebounder with good touch who can also hit an outside shot, and has long enough arms to compensate for positionally relative lack of height. He_s not especially skilled, but if you carve out the right role for him and he commits to doing the small things, he might be a player.",,,,,
Brice Johnson,2016,SI,6/20/16,38,,,"Johnson_s outstanding senior season for the Tar Heels didn_t wipe away three years of inconsistency. His lack of bulk could make his NBA transition tougher, even as a college senior. Still, he_s quite the athlete and could become a viable energy big with his ability to finish on the interior. If a team needs immediate help, he could go higher than this.",,,,,
Petr Cornelie,2016,SI,6/20/16,39,,,"A stretchy, fluid big man with legit size, Cornelie_s ability to shoot it and run the floor should get him picked. Bigs with his type of profile always have intrigue. He_s a solid second-round investment.",,,,,
Zhou Qi,2016,SI,6/20/16,40,,,"He_s enormous, mobile, blocks shots and can shoot jumpers. Zhou also weighs next to nothing and has yet to be tested by elite competition. Could make for a very unique piece ... could also be out of the league very quickly.",,,,,
Chinanu Onuaku,2016,SI,6/20/16,41,,,"He brings a legitimate defensive presence inside and showed well at the combine. He_s got good size, but not much of an offensive skill-set to speak of. Still just 19, Onuaku has a chance to become a rotational big down the line.",,,,,
Gary Payton,2016,SI,6/20/16,42,,,"Of course, the bloodlines are working for Payton, who_s a tremendous athlete and solid defender. His game is well-rounded, but the questions lie with his jump shot, which will likely keep him out of the first round.",,,,,
Robert Carter,2016,SI,6/20/16,43,,,"Another combine standout, Carter has slimmed down from his days at Georgia Tech and presents a wide bag of tricks on offense, both facing up and with his back to the basket. His defense is a different story.",,,,,
Paul Zipser,2016,SI,6/20/16,44,,,"Zipser recently won MVP at the prestigious adidas Eurocamp and has a well-developed set of skills. He_s a pretty good athlete who can play defense and hit a jump shot. If he can does those two things well enough, he has a chance to stick around. He seems to enjoy filling a role.",,,,,
Joel Bolomboy,2016,SI,6/20/16,45,,,"Freakishly athletic with strong mid-major production on his resum‚, Bolomboy_s hallmark ability is rebounding with a dash of everything else sprinkled in. He_s got a somewhat unorthodox game and will need to be molded, but could be quite the dice roll. He_s still a bit raw for his advanced age.",,,,,
Pascal Siakam,2016,SI,6/20/16,46,,,"Siakam_s already 22, but his size, ability to get up and down the floor and competitive spirit helped him stand out at the combine. The native of Cameroon averaged 20 points, nearly 12 rebounds and two blocks last season, and that production combined with his tools make him an intriguing sleeper. He could be a great defender given his length.",,,,,
Guerschon Yabusele,2016,SI,6/20/16,47,,,"Besides having the best name in the draft, Yabusele brings a long, burly frame, good hands and a nice touch at the basket. He can also face up and hit a jump shot. His unique tools should get him picked, but he_s a total work in progress on defense and could stand to slim down.",,,,,
Michael Gbinije,2016,SI,6/20/16,48,,,"The more polished of the two available Syracuse guards, Gbinije was a bit of a forgotten man in college after getting buried at Duke, but bloomed late, showed well at the combine, and has already played internationally for Nigeria. He_s about to turn 24, but his size, playmaking and shooting (though streaky) have appeal.",,,,,
Isaiah Whitehead,2016,SI,6/20/16,49,,,"Though Whitehead is a talented scorer and competitor, you still wonder whether he can handle lead-guard responsibilities in the NBA. His ability to shoot off the dribble sets him apart. He has the ability to go much higher than this, but overall inconsistency and the fact he_ll have to find an actual role beyond _gunner_ leaves room for doubt.",,,,,
Karl-Anthony Towns,2015,SI,6/22/15,1,,,"Towns was a known commodity coming out of high school, having been named the Gatorade National Player of the Year and a McDonald_s All-American. Still, it seemed in November that Duke freshman Jahlil Okafor would remain atop his class (where he_d been since eighth grade) and be selected first in the NBA draft. Okafor may still go No. 1, but Towns is regarded as the superior prospect in most draft rankings. Upside is key with Towns, as his spot-shooting and three-point stroke weren_t on display at Kentucky but could emerge in the right NBA system. His defensive effort and ability_instilled in him by his father, a former player at Monmouth University_have made him the most complete big man in this year_s draft. Towns has ideal size, strength and athleticism to be a star NBA center. He plays with passion on both ends and moves up and down the court well for a player his size. He has the natural feel of an elite shot-blocker and is an above-average rebounder. His offensive game is still developing, but his footwork in the low post is advanced for his age and his free-throw shooting (81.3%) helps support the idea that he may be the second-best shooting big man (behind Frank Kaminsky) in this year_s draft. He plays with his head up and excels at passing out of double teams. He has tremendous potential for growth offensively in the NBA, and the work ethic to become the most valuable long-term pick in this draft. Fouling and physicality were his biggest problems in his one season at Kentucky. He was called for 5.6 fouls per 40 minutes, which negates some of the praise for his ability to block shots. Like many big men, he struggles when stuck near the perimeter, particularly on pick-and-rolls. He flashed an increased assertiveness during the NCAA tournament, but he will be asked to do more right away as a rookie. Is he ready to take on the added responsibility? Physically, another 10-15 pounds on his frame would help prevent him from being pushed around by NBA bigs.",,,,,
Jahlil Okafor,2015,SI,6/22/15,2,,,"In his one season at Duke, the Chicago native commanded the spotlight from start to finish, all the way to a title in Indianapolis. Okafor is as proven a commodity as there is in this draft and the safest bet to have a long, productive career. He_s proven himself under pressure and now has won titles in high school, college, and internationally, at USA Basketball_s developmental levels. His conditioning has been a question in the past, but as Okafor rounds into pro-quality playing shape, he has the talent to be the type of player a team can build its offense around for the next decade. If the modern back-to-the-basket player is a myth, then Okafor is Bigfoot, armed with preternatural instincts within 10 feet of the rim. He enters the NBA with a post game more developed than the majority of big men around the league and is a sure-fire bet to command touches and defensive attention immediately. He_s unselfish, an advanced passer out of double-teams and his midrange game has started to come along. Okafor has the strength to compete inside, the size to guard his position and his 7_5_ wingspan will help him as he develops defensively. It_s more a matter of when, not if, he becomes an offensive anchor. Though his offensive game is rightfully heralded, Okafor_s free-throw shooting leaves a lot to be desired (51% from the line at Duke). If the NBA changes its hacking rules, the concerns die down, but continued struggles would place a cap on his productivity. Okafor_s defensive performance in college stands as a greater issue, as he was often slow on help rotations and isn_t a leaper, which limits his presence when contesting shots. His defensive rebounding could be much better considering his size and length. His offense should keep him on the floor, but he could be a liability in a pick-and-roll heavy league. Improved positioning and communication is teachable, but Okafor could struggle against NBA athletes. He_s been coachable his entire career, which should serve him well.",,,,,
D'Angelo Russell,2015,SI,6/22/15,3,,,"Before college, no one saw D_Angelo Russell coming. In the NBA, no one will miss him. D_Angelo Russell was never really the man on his teams until arriving at Ohio State. He played high school ball at Montverde (Fla.) Prep with Kentucky_s Dakari Johnson and Florida_s Kasey Hill and played AAU with Duke_s Grayson Allen. But in Columbus, he was finally given a chance to be in the spotlight_and he took advantage. Although he was a fringe top-25 recruit in high school, he_ll go no later than No. 5 in the NBA draft. That_s thanks to his prenatural maturity, court awareness and ability to produce points for his teammates and himself. Russell displayed tremendous poise at point guard, despite not having played the position in high school. He has tremendous court vision and perhaps has the best touch on his passes of any prospect in this draft. Some of his turnovers last year, in fact, were due to his teammates_ inability to wield his surprise assists. He has a filthy crossover and handles the ball against top-flight defenders with ease. His 6_9_ wingspan makes him an asset defensively, and his court awareness makes him an underrated pickpocket defensively. Developmentally, he is way ahead of the curve for players his age yet still has tremendous upside. He can shoot from midrange, beyond the three-point line and finish at the rim on drives. He didn_t play point guard for the full year at Ohio State; instead, he slowly took more minutes from Shannon Scott in a hybrid role. He still needs to prove he can be a full-time point guard, but he is too valuable to play exclusively off the ball. He is not an explosive athlete, instead relying on his vision and basketball IQ to get a step on his defenders. On defense, he needs to play with more consistent intensity.",,,,,
Emmanuel Mudiay,2015,SI,6/22/15,4,,,"A native of the Congo, Mudiay moved to the United States when he was 5 years old. In high school in Dallas, he starred alongside former Baylor center Isaiah Austin and won a Class 4A title. Despite offers from Kansas, Kentucky and other top programs, he chose to stay home and go to college at SMU. But the cloud of a possible NCAA investigation instead sent Mudiay to China, where he played professionally for Guandong on a one-year, $1.2 million deal. Where he is selected in the 2015 draft could have an impact on future players choosing to play professionally in Asia over American colleges. Brandon Jennings, who followed a similar path as a teenager and played in Italy in 2008, was drafted No. 10 overall in 2009. Mudiay fits the prototype of the modern NBA point guard with his ability to create shots for his teammates as well as himself. He excels off the dribble and has a killer crossover. When he gets into the lane, he finishes at the rim. In the paint, he can back down smaller guards and exploit mismatches. His size and length are ideal for a lead guard, with his 6_8_ wingspan complementing his lean frame. That wingspan can make him a menace on defense, where he has yet to show his full potential. He has good vision and feel on the defensive end, and he could quickly improve on that end of the floor in the NBA. His 6.5 rebounds per game in China showed his vision and awareness in grabbing long boards. He is very comfortable operating in the pick-and-roll, which is the heart of most NBA offenses. Jump shooting will be his biggest concern in the NBA. According to DraftExpress, he shot 30% from three-point range overseas. He has a tendency to take off-balance shots from bad angles, and that is the cause of some of his struggles, but it doesn_t explain his poor free-throw shooting (58.1%). His mechanics can be suspect, particularly his release. Although he creates lots of good looks for teammates, he is also prone to errant passes and turnovers. He suffered an ankle injury in China, and his health and physical shape are still minor concerns heading into the draft.",,,,,
Mario Hezonja,2015,SI,6/22/15,5,,,"There_s a reason why Hezonja_s top stats come with the caveat _per 36 minutes._ Playing on one of the top teams in Europe, Hezonja only averaged 16.1 minutes per game for FC Barcelona in Euroleague play. There have been multiple reported reasons for his lack of playing time, ranging from his attitude to his tendencies to operate outside to the playbook. But when he has been on the court, Hezonja has shined. He possesses a rare combination of athleticism and shooting ability. Hezonja_s dossier is prototypical for an elite NBA wing player and could excel in a free-flowing system that allows for the 20-year-old to learn on the fly. Hezonja might very well be the best shooter in this draft class. He has picture-perfect form, rising with great elevation and firing shots with an extremely fluid release. He has great size and tremendous athleticism for a wing player in today_s NBA as well. Hezonja is explosive off the dribble, using a quick first step to blow past defenders. And once he gets into the paint, he has the leaping ability and power to finish strong at the rim and challenge bigger defenders. An aggressive offensive player, he isn_t shy about putting his head down in pursuit to the rim. Very few players possess this combination of fundamental skill with sheer elite athleticism. While Hezonja can get to the rim off the bounce, his ball-handling still needs to be tightened. Working towards the top of the key, Hezonja has the tendency to waste movement going east to west and often over-dribbles himself into hoisting poor shots towards the end of the shot clock. Hezonja plays with incredible confidence and swagger, but that has often translated into poor body language on the court when he_s not intricately involved. His behavior has raised serious concerns back to the junior level.",,,,,
Stanley Johnson,2015,SI,6/22/15,6,,,"An intense competitor, Johnson starred for an Arizona team that went to the Elite Eight. Although he may not become a No. 1 option, his two-way ability should make him a valuable piece at the NBA level. He_s a load in transition with tremendous defensive potential and enters the league with a pro-ready body_Johnson is a bit undersized for a small forward, but his athletic gifts help make up for that. He just turned 19 and presents an extremely malleable set of skills. Johnson doesn_t have an elite skill on offense, but does a lot of things very well. He came up in high school relying heavily on bully-ball tactics, as he was bigger, stronger and faster than his peers. At present, he_s a power wing who could eventually be a real threat in half-court situations. His wide lower half could help him develop a back-to-the-basket game and make him an ideal small-ball power forward. He can guard multiple positions and is a great fit for the modern league, with a nearly seven-foot wingspan, quick feet and solid awareness. You can see him playing a valuable jack-of-all-trades defensive role pretty quickly. Extremely confident and good-natured, Johnson should transition just fine. Entering college, people were worried about Johnson_s shooting, but his freshman season at Arizona showcased surprising perimeter ability. He came in as a much better three-point threat (37%) than most envisioned. Johnson didn_t play with many quality shooters at Arizona and a team with better spacing could also mitigate some of his woes. Somewhat surprisingly, he struggled to finish in the paint at times, an area he_ll have to improve upon to become a dynamic threat in the NBA. He might need time to grow into a consistent scorer. Johnson also did little in the way of creating opportunities for others at Arizona, though he_s done that in the past, and it would serve him well at the next level.",,,,,
Justise Winslow,2015,SI,6/22/15,7,,,"Often overshadowed by Jahlil Okafor and Tyus Jones, Winslow was nevertheless critical to Duke_s national championship run last season. The son of former second-round pick Rickie Winslow_who only played in seven NBA games_Justise came to Durham with an NBA-ready body and a skill set that would complement his blue-chip teammates. He quickly became known for his end-to-end speed and was a highlight-reel-in-the-making anytime he touched the ball in transition. He isn_t the most polished player in the draft, but he_ll be able to help teams from Day One and could develop into an All-Star. Winslow_s biggest strength is his prowess in transition. Although he at times appears out of control, he has terrific vision, feel and control. According to Synergy Sports, he averaged 1.156 points per possession on transition plays, the highest of any offensive category. His athleticism is also on display defensively, where he can meet the challenge of defending NBA wings_perhaps the biggest hurdle most young players must overcome to play the 3 position professionally. He was forced to defend power forwards often during his time at Duke and can stand up for himself in the paint; but he_s more of a threat on the perimeter, where his lateral quickness is a big asset. He is also a winner_he was on three state championship teams in high school and won a national title at Duke. Although he has the potential to transition to a wing role in the NBA, he primarily played power forward for the Blue Devils last season. To improve offensively, he needs to work on ball-handling in half-court sets and build a consistent jumper. Although he shot 41.8% from three-point range, he managed just 64.1% from the stripe. After playing on an elite college basketball team, many will wonder if Winslow can carry a team by himself or if he is better suited as a valuable role player.",,,,,
Willy Cauley-Stein,2015,SI,6/22/15,8,,,"Willie Trill Cauley-Stein_he recently legally changed his middle name to Trill_is one of the biggest personalities and best prospects in the NBA draft.

After breaking his leg during the NCAA tournament, Cauley-Stein elected to return for his junior year and blossomed as the Wildcats_ elder statesman. He was one of college basketball_s best defenders on one of the sport_s all-time best defensive teams.Defense, defense, defense. Cauley-Stein is hands-down the best defender in this draft, and that includes guards and wings as well. He is an elite shot-blocker thanks to his awareness, vision and wingspan. He also shines on pick-and-roll defense and can handle guarding ball-handlers on the perimeter. He is comfortable playing from the low block to beyond the three-point arc defensively. His effort and intensity level were second to none on a star-studded Kentucky team last season and he has no problem diving for loose balls, setting screens or generally doing the necessary dirty work. Don_t sleep on his mid-range jump shot, either. His main offensive asset is as a rebounder, where he has good vision and length to track down boards. Offense, offense, offense. Cauley-Stein_s main offensive move in college was exploiting undersized centers for dunks. He has almost no moves in the low block and hasn_t shown an ability to back down defenders. He at times looks lost on the offensive end of the floor and can struggle with positioning. He has improved dramatically as a free-throw shooter_from 37.2% as a freshman to 61.7% a year ago_but must show more of an ability to consistently hit 15-footers if he wants to play big minutes as a pro. He has often been accused of being too passive, and indeed he had some truly bad games even a year ago at Kentucky.

Frank Kaminsky,2015,SI,6/22/15,9,,,"The 22-year-old senior went from also-ran to Wooden Award winner during his four years at Wisconsin. In 2014, he was the only D-I player to average 17 points, 8 rebounds, 2 assists, and 1.5 blocks per game. He led the Badgers to regular season and Big Ten tournament titles, en route to a deep NCAA tourney run. Kaminsky dominated the highly-touted Wildcats frontline in the national semifinals, posting 20 points and 11 rebounds, followed by a 21 and 12 showing in a loss to Jahlil Okafor_s Duke Blue Devils. Kaminsky is a versatile offensive player with the best inside-outside game in the draft. An ideal stretch big at the four or five, Kaminsky shot 41.6% from three-point range during his senior season. His shot allows him to pump-fake and drive by opponents and he has the adequate foot speed and ball-handling to get to the rim. He boasts an underrated post game with excellent footwork and an array of moves. His shot selection is second to none, as he primarily shoots from just above the right elbow beyond the three-point line or drives in to finish at the rim. He rarely takes a long two or a bad shot in general. Simply put, Kaminsky lacks ideal strength and athleticism. He_s not going to be able to run with elite athletes in the NBA and he isn_t a game-changer on defense. He does pose excellent awareness on that end and he was a better rim protector than Okafor, for example, but he could struggle against bigger NBA centers. On offense, double teams give him issues in the post and he will occasionally struggle to find the open man. Kaminsky would benefit from a year or two of NBA physical conditioning so he_s able to guard stronger bigs down low.",,,,,
Kristaps Porzingis,2015,SI,6/22/15,10,,,"The most intriguing international player in this year_s draft, Porzingis_s star has been on the rise for the past two years in Europe. He originally entered the 2014 NBA draft, but pulled out as the date drew near. Returning to play in Europe for Sevilla for another season, he was named the Eurocup Rising Star last year. He is also a two-time all-ACB (Spain_s top pro league) selection. Despite his slender frame, his size and perimeter skills have NBA teams intrigued. The popularity of the stretch-four position has created an increased desire for fives who can shoot three-pointers as well, and Porzingis fits that model well. Porzingis is a true 7-footer with the athleticism of a much smaller player. Having played professionally in Europe, his skills are more developed than many American big men. His shot is a thing of beauty, with a high release point and a quick trigger. He is more the mold of a stretch-four in a center_s body, but he makes up for his inability to back down opponents with an excellent shot over either shoulder. He hustles in transition and can often exploit slower big men tasked with guarding him. His best fit would be with a fast-paced team that likes to run the floor. He isn_t an elite jumper, but he finishes at the rim whenever he can. At 19, his upside is tough to calculate, particularly if he can maintain speed while adding weight to his frame. With a slightly more developed low-post game, he could become a matchup nightmare. Unlike Jahlil Okafor, Karl-Anthony Towns or even Willie Cauley-Stein, Porzingis is not an NBA-ready big man. But with the right amount of time and development, he could be a matchup problem as a stretch four. Porzingis will likely get pushed around by NBA centers until he can add some weight to his frame. What position he will play, and what position he will defend, could become problems early on for the team that drafts him. On offense, he has made up for his lack of post moves by becoming an excellent jump shooter, but he has no answers on defense when caught in the low post with players his own height. He is not an excellent rebounder and gets boxed out far too often for a player of his size.",,,,,
Myles Turner,2015,SI,6/22/15,11,,,"After memorably donning a bucket hat to announce his commitment to Texas, Turner found significantly fewer buckets than expected waiting for him in Austin. Still, he presents one of this draft_s more unique risk-reward propositions. Right now, he_s a face-up player with a power forward_s skills who will have to defend centers given some athletic limitations. He has good instincts as a shot-blocker and the size to be a factor on that end. There have been questions about his unusual gait (contributed to in part by size 21 feet) that had him marked as an injury risk, not to mention a history of ankle and foot problems. But his size and shooting ability are what will get him drafted early. Turner has a nice, high release on his shot that will translate well to the next level. He_s confident in the mid-range and should be able to extend out to the NBA three on a consistent basis in time with his soft touch. That_s where the LaMarcus Aldridge comparisons hail from_bigs that can both shoot and defend the rim will always be in demand. On the defensive end, Turner performed well at Texas despite being slow-footed and should be the type of guy you can park around the rim. He_s slim, but adding muscle is rarely a problem once NBA trainers get their hands on a prospect. He_s also an above-average rebounder, and presents good potential value based on where he_s projected. Turner lacks much of a post game beyond his trusty turnaround jumpers and doesn_t push people around inside. He_ll need to expand that area of his game at least enough to keep defenses honest. He_s not a great playmaker with the ball, a dimension that could augment his role on the inside. Turner isn_t a freak athlete and was a non-factor in transition for Texas, which doesn_t help his case in an uptempo league. Though he_s one of the better shot-blockers in this draft, foul trouble was a theme during his freshman year. Given his heavy feet, defending pick and rolls might be the major issue here. Unless his offense grows enough to make those deficiencies playable, Turner could be nothing more than a role player.",,,,,
Devin Booker,2015,SI,6/22/15,12,,,"Booker is one of seven Kentucky players who declared for the draft in April after the Wildcats came within two wins of becoming the first undefeated college team since 1976. A native of Grand Rapids, Mich., who played high school basketball in Mississippi, Booker logged 21.5 minutes per game on a deep Kentucky team loaded with NBA talent. Yet he wasn_t overshadowed by frontcourt teammates and projected top-10 picks Karl-Anthony Towns and Willie Cauley-Stein. The true freshman was named the Southeastern Conference_s Sixth Man of the Year and earned second team All-SEC honors even though he endured a shooting slump late in the season. Booker is considered one of the best shooters in this draft class. In his lone season at Kentucky, he connected on 41.1% of his three-point attempts and knocked down 83% of his tries from the free-throw line. He_s also lethal when spotting up, averaging 1.17 points per possession on that play type last season, according to Synergy Sports. But Booker showed there_s more to his game than shooting, as he successfully manufactured space and created shots off the dribble. The threat of Booker beating his man on a cut or darting into space for quick catch-and-shoot opportunity will force defenses to keep tabs on him whenever he_s on the floor. Though he didn_t create many scoring opportunities for his teammates, Booker rarely committed turnovers. His height and weight project favorably for a pro shooting guard, and as the youngest player in this draft class, he_s far from a finished product. It_s not clear if Booker has any NBA-level skills other than his shooting. At Kentucky, he was surrounded by so much talent that he functioned more as a role player than go-to scorer. Booker should inherit a similar role in the NBA, but a team looking for big-time shot creator right away may be wary of selecting him too high in this draft. Booker_s lack of defensive disruptiveness may be cause for concern. He posted a lower steal rate than every other Kentucky player who averaged at least 11 minutes per game and blocked only 0.3% of opponents_ two-point attempts, according to kenpom.com.",,,,,
Sam Dekker,2015,SI,6/22/15,13,,,"Dekker is a folk hero in the state of Wisconsin, winning a state championship in high school on a last-second shot and leading the Badgers to back-to-back Final Fours. By now, he should have shed the shooter-only label after performing well at the combine, and if you buy his statistical leap during the tourney, Dekker could be a mid-round steal. He has two-way potential and holds additional appeal because he could contribute right away as a role player. Dekker_s ability to score combined with his quality athleticism and ability to guard several positions make him a good fit for the NBA. He_s been a streaky three-point shooter in the past, but if he becomes more consistent beyond the arc, he_ll have a well-rounded offensive game that could lend itself to playing the four in small-ball situations. Given his size and tools on the defensive end (the one knock is that his wingspan is a relatively short 6_11_), it_s easy to see Dekker, a highly intelligent, competitive player, having a long career as a useful role player, if not more. A lot of Dekker_s success hinges on the sustainability of his shooting. While there_s no reason to believe he won_t be able to improve his stroke, his skill package is far less attractive and versatile if the three-ball doesn_t become a reliable part of his arsenal. He_s good, not great, with the ball in his hands and there_s the aforementioned issue of his short arms. These are all nitpicky criticisms, and Dekker would appear to be a fairly safe choice. He_ll go as far as his jumper can take him.",,,,,
Rondae Hollis-Jefferson,2015,SI,6/22/15,14,,,"Most people know two things about Hollis-Jefferson, the intriguing, athletic Arizona wing not named Stanley Johnson: he_s an incredible athlete and he can_t shoot a lick. His defensive potential is as high as any player in this draft, and with his strength and mobility, he should be able to switch onto guards and bigs alike. Offensively, he_s a slasher and transition threat, which (given his talent on the other end) should be enough to keep him on the court even if he never develops a jump shot. Hollis-Jefferson could go anywhere from the mid-lottery to the mid-20s and brings one of the draft_s more unique talent bundles. You can never undervalue elite perimeter defense as a skill. What_s even better, Hollis-Jefferson loves to defend and seems to understand where his money will come from. With a 7-foot wingspan, strong instincts and explosiveness, he can match up with just about anybody and plays hard all the time. He_s frequently around the ball and rebounds aggressively. As the league-wide trend toward perimeter-heavy lineups continues, guys like Hollis-Jefferson will be increasingly in demand. Well, he really can_t shoot. In two years at Arizona, Hollis-Jefferson totaled eight made three-pointers on 39 attempts, so while he_s bad, at least he_s not forcing it. His mechanics need major work, and if he can just establish a presence from mid-range, it should be enough to keep him in most rotations. While he_s terrific with a clear path to the basket, he_s not a creative dribbler and doesn_t present that much of a half-court threat. He should at least be a contributor of some type on the offensive end, but this could conceivably be a disaster area that relegates him to specialist duty.",,,,,
Bobby Portis,2015,SI,6/22/15,15,,,"A two-year standout at Arkansas, Portis finished a second-team All-America selection in 2015.

Wooden Award. Portis was mentored by former Arkansas great Corliss Williamson, who was coincidently the last Razorback named the SEC Player of the Year. Portis is a relentless rebounder, especially on the offensive glass (4.5 offensive rebounds per game). He plays with a motor that doesn_t stop, attacking the boards with a fervor NBA teams will love. The mechanics of his jumper aren_t great, but they get the job done, even out to the three-point line, where he hit 46.7% of his shots last season. Although Portis isn_t an elite athlete, he has the foot speed to guard bigs on the perimeters as well as get by them off the bounce. Lack of athleticism and strength make him an oddly sub-standard defensive rebounder for a player his size. Additionally, despite good length, Portis isn_t an elite rim protector or shot blocker. Most of Portis_s points come off energy plays, hustle, and open jump shots, as he_s not going to create a ton of offense on his own. You can_t just give him the ball on the block and ask him to go to work. Portis_s post game isn_t refined, but given his soft touch as a jump-shooter, it_s an area he could develop down the line.",,,,,
Jerian Grant,2015,SI,6/22/15,16,,,"Grant helped Notre Dame morph into one of the most efficient offenses in the country last season. Though he led the Irish in scoring, Grant was also the team_s best facilitator, posting an assist rate that ranked among the nation_s top 40. As capable as Grant is at setting up teammates, he is also as capable of creating his own looks. In 2014-15, he averaged more than 18 points per 40 minutes, adjusted for pace, and made better than 57% of his two-point attempts. Grant particularly excelled in transition last season, as he averaged more than 1.2 points per possession on those situations, according to Synergy Sports. In addition, his size projects well for an NBA point guard. While he established himself as a capable scorer and playmaker at Notre Dame, Grant doesn_t project as a top-flight long-range shooter. He connected on 34.5% of his three-point attempts during his time at Notre Dame, and only 31.6% during his senior season. Grant recorded one of the highest steal rates among ACC players during conference play in 2015 and has the potential to become a solid perimeter defender because of his size and athleticism, but he didn_t distinguish himself favorably on that end of the floor during his time at Notre Dame. Though Grant had more time to hone his game in college, he is 22 entering the draft_significantly older than many top prospects.",,,,,
Kevon Looney,2015,SI,6/22/15,17,,,"Hyped out of high school, Looney had a solid freshman year at UCLA, but it didn_t quite live up to the billing. Looney remains intriguing physically with a 7_3_ wingspan, but showed up with a somewhat alarming 11.9% body fat at the draft combine. He_s a strong rebounder but NBA teams are interested because of his perimeter skills and stretch-four potential. During his prep career, Looney operated as a scorer all over the floor, whereas at UCLA he flashed his jump shot but didn_t receive the same freedom to operate. He could go anywhere in the back half of the first round. The most translatable skill for Looney is clearly his rebounding on both ends of the floor. His stretch-four upside is the key here, and if he becomes a consistent three-point threat, there should be a place for him in the NBA. On the defensive side, his long arms allow him to be disruptive and he should be able to guard his position and switch onto wings situationally. If Looney_s shot develops to the point where his team can deploy him as a small-ball five a la Golden State_s Draymond Green, he_ll be an especially useful cog in someone_s machine. Looney needs to do more than just rebound to earn minutes, and it_s not clear yet how his offensive skills will diversify. In the pros, he_ll face athletes that can outleap him and negate his length advantage. Lacking any semblance of a post game, Looney needs his shots to be created for him in order to be a factor until he expands his arsenal. There are also some questions about his conditioning, and he_s a project who will especially require the right team and development plan to succeed. Right now the D-League isn_t out of the question, and working in Looney_s favor is the fact he_s 19 years old.",,,,,
Tyus Jones,2015,SI,6/22/15,18,,,"Here we have the rare case of a player who is still being undervalued despite a March Madness breakout. We_ve seen players of Jones_s ilk before, point guards who bring clich‚ strengths to the table: he_s a gamer, a guy who makes his teammates better, who simply understands how to play the game and almost always impacts the game in a positive way. Mudiay and Russell are the headliners, but Jones should be the third point guard off the board. At worst, the Final Four MVP looks like a steady backup. At best, he_s somebody_s point guard of the future. A natural leader and distributor, Jones is a cerebral player who gets the job done. He was regarded as the top point guard in his class for much of high school, and his teams have almost always won. He checks all the intangible boxes, including a notable competitive streak. Don_t expect him to be a big-time scorer, but he won_t need to be in order to have success. Jones looks suited to step into a backup role immediately, and it_s tough to bet against his track record. Considering the number of special NBA guards who_ve had plenty of success without sexy athletic attributes, Jones could be a steal in the middle of the first round. Jones doesn_t fit the current chic mold of a big explosive ball-handler and will have a shorter leash as a result. Trey Burke could be a recent detrimental point of comparison, though Jones has better size and is a more instinctive playmaker at the same stage. As a freshman he quieted the talk about his inconsistent perimeter shooting (37% from deep). The next thing he_ll have to show is whether he can cut it defensively as a pro. The million-dollar question is if Jones_s lack of athleticism will overshadow his considerable strengths. It_s a critique we_ve seen successful point guards dismiss plenty of times before.",,,,,
Trey Lyles,2015,SI,6/22/15,19,,,"It_s possible that Lyles_s stock could have been higher had he not been part of Kentucky_s star-studded rotation. The worst part about the Wildcats_ rotation for Lyles is that he was often playing out of position at small forward. After Alex Poythress went down, Lyles_s star rose accordingly, proving he_s one of the more skilled power forwards in this draft. He_s a true four-man both size- and skill-wise who fits both in half-court and transition play. While he doesn_t have one elite talent, Lyles is one of the draft_s most well-rounded offensive big men. Lyles is able to do a little bit of everything and is comfortable attacking off the dribble, finishing at the basket and has the makings of a solid post game. He_s a good passer and face-up player with a decent mid-range game, and the development of his three-point shot will be key to his value. While the prospect of Lyles as a stretch-four is enticing, he has enough talent and versatility to become a very solid offensive cog, though he may never be a true star. He_s just 19 and has plenty of time to polish his game, and there_s plenty for teams to work with. The main strike against Lyles is that he lacks top-level leaping and quickness. His offensive skills, especially with added shooting range could certainly make up for that. Though he wasn_t that productive statistically, you have to remember how things work at Kentucky. Plus, his per-minute stats are more forgiving. It_s Lyles_s defense that begs the most questions_he won_t be able to guard small forwards like he did at Kentucky. While Lyles can match most four-men from a physical standpoint, he_s not a shot-blocker.

Justin Anderson,2015,SI,6/22/15,20,,,"After growing up in Virginia, Anderson stayed in-state for college, committing to Virginia over Maryland, Texas and Virginia Tech. He assumed secondary roles his first two seasons in Charlottesville, averaging under eight points per game. His junior season marked an emergence into the spotlight, but also two setbacks. He was arguably the best player on a Virginia team that spent most of the season ranked in the top 5, averaging 12.2 points a game on 46.6% shooting and hitting 45.2% of his threes. But Anderson also battled injuries, missing eight games late in the season to a broken finger and then an appendectomy. He didn_t fully recover in time to save Virginia from a season-ending loss to Michigan State in the NCAA tournament Round of 32. Anderson anchored Virginia_s stellar defense, using his long arms and quickness to guard perimeter players and his strength to match up with bigger players in the post. He has also developed an offensive game to match his defense, shooting 46.6% from the field and 45.2% from three-point range last season, up dramatically from 40.7% and 29.4%, respectively, in 2013-14. His improvement from behind the three-point line_which follows dramatic changes in his shooting form_is especially encouraging. He could fit easily on any NBA roster as a prototypical _three and D_ wing. He_s also an athletic leaper who wouldn_t be out of place in a dunk contest. Anderson_s offensive game still could use work. He can_t do much in isolation situations, and he made fewer than half of his two-point attempts each of his three years at Virginia. Sub-par ball-handling skills prevent him from being a go-to option on offense. He_ll need to improve his handle to contribute as an NBA guard. As it is, he_s a bit of a _tweener on offense, with a skill set more befitting of a small forward at the professional level. He also needs to show that his sudden shooting improvement was no fluke.

He_s obviously an undersized big, but his ridiculous wingspan, measured at over 7_4_ at the combine, does wonders for his cause. A unique body type, strong rebounding r‚sum‚ and active motor cast Harrell potentially as sort of a poor man_s Tristan Thompson. Harrell is tough, runs the floor and finishes extremely well. He_ll play above the rim and has improved his shooting touch on free throws and mid-range attempts. Cleaning the glass has been his constant calling card as a prospect, and he_s got the necessary nasty streak and high-energy style to succeed given his build. Defensively, he held his own in college and plays extremely tough, which has to continue in the NBA. If that happens, he should be able to play both power forward and even some small-ball center, causing problems on the interior and covering up for some of his teammates_ mistakes. Beyond the offensive glass, it_s unclear where Harrell_s scoring will come from at the next level. He_s not really a back-to-the-basket type and his jumper remains a work in progress. The combined number that hurts him is 11.9% body fat, which is somewhat mysterious.

Kelly Oubre Jr,2015,SI,6/22/15,22,,,"A few months after losing Andrew Wiggins to the NBA draft, Kansas added another highly regarded wing in its incoming recruiting class.

In all, Oubre played a considerable role for a Jayhawks team that won 27 games, clinched a share of their 11th straight Big 12 regular-season title and earn a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tourney. Oubre possesses the potential to develop into a versatile perimeter defender. His combination of length (7_2 «_ wingspan), athleticism and awareness should allow him to guard multiple positions in the NBA.

Oubre could develop into a solid floor-spacer in the NBA, but his jump shot was inconsistent at Kansas. Over his final eight regular season games, Oubre connected on only 18.8% of his treys. Oubre also didn_t display a consistent ability to create good shot opportunities inside the arc. He sank 38% of his mid-range shots and converted fewer than 50% of his two-point attempts. Oubre didn_t distinguish himself as a playmaker, either, as he recorded 1.4 assists per 40 minutes (adjusted for pace), fewer than frontcourt teammates Perry Ellis and Jamari Traylor.

Payne never looked back, emerging as one of the elite point guards in the country. Leading the Racers_ offense, Payne guided Murray State to the 13th-most efficient offense in the nation this season, per kenpom.com. He ranked 15th in the nation in assists per game. He recently suffered a fractured ring finger on his non-shooting hand. The injury does not require surgery, but Payne will not workout for anymore teams before the draft. Payne has the one true necessary skill of a point guard in today_s NBA: A mastery of the pick-and-roll. He_s crafty working in various pick-and-roll sets, using his next-level decision-making ability, pull-up jumper and fluid floater to keep defenses off balance. He possesses the vision and ball-handling abilities of an NBA point guard, and he really shines in the open court. What makes Payne an especially intriguing prospect to scouts is his length and defensive versatility. At just under 6_2_, Payne measured an exceptional 6_7 ¬_ wingspan. Combine that with his quickness and Payne could potentially guard the majority of all NBA wings. Like many 20-year-old prospects, Payne needs to add muscle in order to survive at the next level. His floater is truly a weapon, but he struggles getting all the way to the rim and has difficulties finishing. Payne_s struggle to reach the tin against mid-major opponents is definitely concerning. His funky shooting form is also a cause for some pause.",,,,,
Jonathan Holmes,2015,SI,6/22/15,24,,,"A decorated four-year player at Texas, Holmes played in 127 games for the Longhorns stacking up 1,166 points. He was a top-100 recruit out of San Antonio who stepped right into a key role for UT. He finished his 2014-15 season with All-Conference Honorable Mention honors in the Big 12. Holmes has solid mechanics on his jumper and has displayed range out to the three-point line (33%). He_s also an excellent rebounder for a wing player. He competes hard and shows good floor awareness. Holmes has the frame and skill to back down smaller defenders to score, while also possessing the ability to take bigger defenders off the dribble. He_s a versatile forward who may be best utilized as a stretch-four for a team looking for a plug-and-play offensive player. What position does he play in the NBA? Holmes would be miscast as a creator or scorer off the dribble. He_s a good shooter, but not a consistent one, with his jumper ranging from white-hot to ice-cold. He has the defensive ability and foot quickness to guard wing players on switches, but whether or not he can handle NBA bigs consistently is certainly a concern. Although he flashed the ability to take advantage of smaller players on the offensive end, it wasn_t something he did with enough assertiveness at Texas.",,,,,
R.J. Hunter,2015,SI,6/22/15,25,,,"Hunter garnered national attention in March when he drained a long three-point shot to upset No. 3 seed Baylor in the opening round of the NCAA tournament. R.J._s father, Georgia State head coach Ron, memorably fell out of his chair while celebrating the shot. The win ensured the No. 14 seed Panthers posted at least 25 victories for the second consecutive season, with Hunter serving as the leading scorer and winning the Sun Belt Player of the year award in both 2013-14 and _14-15. A three-star recruit from Indianapolis, Ind., Hunter rejected reported scholarship offers from high-major programs to play for his dad. The main reason Hunter is a coveted NBA prospect is his shooting ability. Though his three-point percentage declined from 39.7 to 29.9 between his sophomore and junior seasons, he finished No. 15 in the country in long-range attempts in _14-15, which accounted for 51% of his total field goal attempts. Hunter drew nearly six fouls per 40 minutes during conference play, according to kenpom.com, and made good on his trips to the line, converting at an 88.7% clip. He profiles as a complementary scorer in the NBA, but Hunter flashed the ability to facilitate offensive opportunities for his teammates, as he recorded just over four assists per 40 minutes in _14-15, adjusted for pace. Hunter did not offset his dip in three-point accuracy with improved shooting inside the arc. Playing the majority of his games against subpar competition in a weaker conference, Hunter connected on only 36.6% of his two-point jump shots last season. Though Hunter possesses favorable length (6_10 «__ wingspan) and recorded a 3.4 steal percentage and 4.6 block percentage during Sun Belt play last season, it_s tough to say whether he_ll be able to hold his own defensively in the NBA after spending so much of his time at GSU in a zone defense.",,,,,
Christian Wood,2015,SI,6/22/15,26,,,"Wood has all the physical gifts you can ask for. He_s 6_11_ with a 7_3_ wingspan and great athleticism. He moves extremely well for a player of his size, which will allow him to guard more agile big men in the NBA. He_s a good finisher at the rim, particularly off lobs, which makes him an ideal pick-and-roll candidate. He has impressive ball-handling abilities, allowing him to run fast breaks by himself, and while he_s no sharp-shooter, he and can hit mid-range jumpers and even the occasional three. With some development, he could help stretch the floor in the NBA. He rebounded well at UNLV, thanks in large part to his length, and blocked loads of shots as well. And given his raw skills, he has room to improve in all these areas going forward. He_ll need to fill out in order to match up with bulkier big men in the NBA. For now, he needs to improve his fundamentals both on defense and on the boards. Long arms were enough to accumulate blocks and rebounds in the Mountain West, but he_ll need to be smarter in the pros. All around, Wood lacks polish, with his effort and decision-making sometimes raising questions. His shot-selection a significant problem. On offense, he shows promise but needs to refine his game and develop a reliable weapon outside of lobs and transition dunks.",,,,,
Delon Wright,2015,SI,6/22/15,27,,,"Academic problems in high school prevented Wright from joining a D-I program right away. Instead, he starred at City College of San Francisco for two years before moving to Utah as a junior college transfer. He was twice named first team All-Pac-12 and to the conference_s All-Defensive team. After leading Utah to a 26-9 record in 2014-15, Wright was named a second team All-America. His older brother, Dorell Wright, plays for the Trail Blazers. A do-it-all point guard with outstanding size for the position. Wright gets by with craft rather than overpowering athleticism. He_s a smart, decisive player who can score, distribute and rebound well for his position. An efficient scorer despite not being a great shooter overall, Wright has a knack for getting to his spots and finding creases. The senior can also defend and has a knack for creating steals and tips due to his length and excellent anticipation into passing lanes. Occasionally, he has trouble finishing around the rim, and he doesn_t have the elite athleticism you look for in a starting NBA point guard. Outside shooting will be a question, despite a decent three-point percentage as a senior (35.6%). Teams seeking upside players in the first round will worry about Wright_s age.",,,,,
Rashad Vaughn,2015,SI,6/22/15,28,,,"Vaughn was a McDonald_s All-American after transferring to Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nev., from his hometown of Golden Valley, Minn. A five-star recruit in the class of 2014, he chose nearby UNLV over Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina and others. He made an immediate impact for the Runnin_ Rebels, scoring 26 points in his first college game and averaging 17.8 points during his freshman season, the second-best mark in the Mountain West. Vaughn_s season ended prematurely in February when he tore the meniscus in his left knee in a game against Fresno State. Vaughn is 18 years old, making him one of the draft_s youngest players. And at 6_6_, he has good size for his position. He_s a natural scorer, with the ability to make shots from anywhere on the floor, over any level of defense. As a freshman, he scored in bunches and excelled as a shooter especially in catch-and-shoot scenarios. He also does well in isolation and can create off the dribble. With his size and relative athleticism, he has potential to be a capable defender, if not better. Vaughn shot 43.9% from the field last season and will need to be more efficient at the next level. That means improving his shot selection, resisting contested shots and also becoming a more willing passer. His low assist rate in _14-15 underlines his resistance to find the open man or create opportunities for others. He_s not particularly long or strong, so he_ll have to work to become a good rebounder and defender. He_s not the most athletic player in the draft, so he_ll need to be crafty at getting to the rim and improve at finishing when he gets there. Otherwise, he risks becoming solely a spot-up shooter.",,,,,
Robert Upshaw,2015,SI,6/22/15,29,,,"Upshaw is one of the biggest question marks in this draft. With his defensive potential, especially his elite rim protection, the former Washington big man has the talent and physical makeup of a lottery pick. He has a checkered past, having been dismissed from two schools reportedly for substance abuse issues. He also has possible health issues, as he was flagged at the combine with heart issues. He could end up dropping to the end of the first round or out of it entirely due to those concerns. But his fall could end up a blessing in disguise. He would miss out on guaranteed money, but he could begin his NBA career in an established system and culture and with lower expectations. Upshaw_s draft stock is primarily rooted in his reputation as an elite shot-blocker, which is a disservice to the big man_s overall defensive prowess. He_s a solid post defender and also has good awareness on switches, especially when he_s directly involved in pick-and-rolls as well as shadowing pick-and-rolls from the weakside. He uses his exceptional length to the best of his abilities, making the most of his 7_5 «_ wingspan and 9_5_ standing reach. Upshaw was an efficient rebounder as well, grabbing 13.1 per 40 minutes this season. The big man even showed competent ball skills on the perimeter, which bode well for his transition to offensive systems heavy on dribble hand-offs from bigs around the high post. With Upshaw, character is a major concern, after being booted from Washington and Fresno State in two years. He has since hired a life coach and has worked diligently to put his worst days behind him, but his past is certainly worrisome. Upshaw is also lacking in lower-body strength, which hinders his ability to muscle against other big men in the paint. Upshaw has significant troubles at the foul line as well, converting just 43.4% throughout his college career.",,,,,
Jarrell Martin,2015,SI,6/22/15,30,,,"Originally considered a potential one-and-done candidate, Martin returned to LSU for his sophomore year and helped lead the Tigers to a 22-10 regular season and a No. 9 seed in the NCAA tournament. Martin continued to impress with his elite athleticism and certainly looks the part of a modern NBA four-man with his perimeter playmaking skills and ability to face-up. The biggest cause for concern is his big dip in three-point shooting, a skill that has become prevalent at the four in today_s NBA. With an improved defensive approach and heightened basketball IQ, Martin could build a long NBA career as a fringe starter. When watching Martin, it_s obvious he possess exceptional athleticism and quickness for a player his size. His leaping ability (34.5"" max vertical at the NBA draft combine) allowed him to get up and finish with the best in college basketball last season and also makes him a force on the offensive glass. He runs the floor like a gazelle and truly thrives in transition. In the half-court, he utilizes a polished face-up game that extends to about 15 feet out. He can both roll to the basket in the pick-and-roll or pop out to set up his solid mid-range game. Defensively, he_s shown the ability to body up bigger opponents one-on-one on the block as well. Martin regressed shooting-wise from the outside in his second collegiate season, shooting just 26.9% from three-point land after converting 33.3% of his attempts from outside as a freshman. He also struggles scoring in the post, which is a major factor in his preference to face-up when looking to score. His awareness hurts him defensively in terms of rotations and positioning, which impacts defensive rebounding. For a player who attacks the offensive glass in his own right, Martin loses far too many offensive rebounds to his opponents. His average length and wingspan might turn a few teams off as well.",,,,,
